# Treasury-Yield-Analysis

This project implemented ETL pipelines to extract (via API and Web Scraping), manipulate and store records of US Quarterly GDP, S&P 500 and Daily Treasury Yield Curve Rates from various sources (BEA, Yahoo Finance, US Treasury) into a database.

Visualizations regarding trend lines and correlations of US Quarterly GDP, S&P 500, Daily Changes in Treasury Yield Curve Rates and Daily 10-Year Yields were developed in Tableau.
